# Exploring the traffic accidents dataset

Data used for this notebook represents traffic accidents in Serbia, by police departments, for year 2022, and it comes from [open data](https://data.gov.rs/sr/datasets/) provided by Republic of Serbia.

The idea was to train different models with informations about traffic accidents, such as the time of the accident, type of the accident, etc, and predict the outcome of new traffic accidents based on those informations.
